# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial expression plays a very important and fundemental role in human communiacations and recognizing expressions is extremely significant for comprehension of interactive behaviour.
we use stacking  which is a well-known and advanced ensemble techniques for facial expression recognition. Stacking models are made up of two leyers of models: base models layer and meta model layer.
In this study pre-trained convolutional neural networks are used as the base layer models and a tree boosting model is used in the meta-stacking layer.
we have used important libraries including:
keras,
tensorflow,
numpy,
cv2,
...
